                <p>
                    I am an avid gamer that loves programming. 
                    I volunteer at FIRST Lego League Challenge which is a competition and NGO to teach children to think and do research. 
                    I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Witwatersrand.

                    Latest Project
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I made a bot that played the Snake game against 3 other snakes on the field with obstacles. 
                    The snake had to compete against the 3 other snakes on the same board to survive the longest and grow the most. 
                    After 5 minutes the winner would be decided by longest length.
